# IWOMI 2024 Tutorial: STOUT and DECIMER

## Overview

This tutorial covers two powerful tools: STOUT-V2 and DECIMER. STOUT-V2 is a SMILES to IUPAC name translator using transformers, capable of translating SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) to IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) names and vice versa. DECIMER, on the other hand, is a powerful tool designed for molecular extraction, enabling users to unravel the complexities of chemical structures with ease.

## STOUT-V2: SMILES to IUPAC Name Translator

The STOUT-V2 folder contains a step-by-step guide on how to train the STOUT-V2 model. This transformer-based model can translate SMILES to IUPAC names and IUPAC names back to valid SMILES strings. The folder provides detailed instructions and examples to help you through the training process, making it accessible for both experienced and novice users.

## DECIMER: Molecular Extraction Tool

DECIMER offers an intuitive approach to molecular extraction, empowering users to decipher intricate compounds and simplify data analysis. Whether you're a seasoned chemist or a curious newcomer, DECIMER promises an enriching experience.

### Why DECIMER?

DECIMER is a go-to solution for various molecular extraction tasks, including:

- Deciphering complex chemical structures
- Simplifying data analysis
- Extracting relevant information from chemical compounds
- Facilitating research and exploration in the field of chemistry

## Text Extraction with OpenAI

Additionally, this tutorial covers text extraction from PDFs using a fine-tuned OpenAI model. This technique allows for efficient extraction of relevant information from PDF documents, further enhancing the versatility of the tools presented.

## Hands-on Experience

Throughout this tutorial, you'll have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with both STOUT-V2 and DECIMER. Through practical examples and guided exercises, you'll learn how to leverage these powerful tools to streamline your workflow and unlock new possibilities in molecular analysis and manipulation.

Get ready to embark on an exciting journey through the world of chemical informatics and molecular extraction!
